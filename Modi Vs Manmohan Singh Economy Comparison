Comparing the economic performances of Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi during their tenures as Prime Minister of India requires looking at various economic indicators such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate, fiscal deficit, unemployment rate, and other relevant factors. Here's a comparison based on available data:

GDP Growth Rate:

During Manmohan Singh's tenure (2004-2014), India experienced robust economic growth, with an average GDP growth rate of around 7-8%.
Under Narendra Modi's tenure (2014-2024), the GDP growth rate has been more variable. It experienced highs of over 8% in some years but also dropped to around 4-5% in others. The average growth rate during his tenure is around 6-7%.

Inflation was relatively high during the early years of Manmohan Singh's tenure but was brought under control later. The average inflation rate during his tenure was around 6-7%.
Under Narendra Modi's tenure, inflation has generally remained moderate, with average inflation ranging from 3-5%.
Fiscal Deficit:

During Manmohan Singh's tenure, the fiscal deficit was a matter of concern, with the government struggling to contain it within acceptable limits. It hovered around 4-5% of GDP on average.
Narendra Modi's government has also faced challenges in managing the fiscal deficit, which has averaged around 3-4% of GDP during his tenure.
Unemployment Rate:

Unemployment rates during Manmohan Singh's tenure varied, with no clear trend. However, there was a focus on job creation through various schemes.
Under Narendra Modi's tenure, there have been efforts to address unemployment through initiatives such as Make in India, Skill India, and Mudra Yojana. However, unemployment rates have remained a concern, especially in recent years.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):

FDI inflows increased steadily during Manmohan Singh's tenure, with sectors like IT, telecommunications, and services attracting significant investments.
Under Narendra Modi, FDI inflows have continued to grow, with efforts to liberalize FDI policies and attract investment across various sectors.
Ease of Doing Business:

India's ranking in the Ease of Doing Business index improved during both Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi's tenures, with the latter making substantial progress in streamlining regulatory processes and improving the business environment.
It's important to note that various external and internal factors influence economic performance, and a direct comparison may not fully capture the complexities involved. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic indicators during Narendra Modi's tenure, presenting unique challenges not faced during Manmohan Singh's tenure.
