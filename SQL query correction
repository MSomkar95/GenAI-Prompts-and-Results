# MS Omkar:
Acting as an SQL expert could you please advice if the following SQL query for MySQL is properly framed? "SELECT COUNT(id) AS 'Month to Date Applications' FROM bank_data;
WHERE MONTH(issue_date)= 12 AND YEAR (issue_date)= 2021 "


# ChatGPT:
The SQL query you provided has a small issue in its syntax. The WHERE clause should be placed before the semicolon and after the table name. Here's the corrected version:
sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(id) AS 'Month to Date Applications' 
FROM bank_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date) = 12 AND YEAR(issue_date) = 2021;
With this correction, the query should work properly in MySQL. It counts the number of entries in the bank_data table where the issue_date falls within December 2021.


# MS Omkar:
Acting as an SQL expert could you please advice if the following SQL query for MySQL is properly framed? select ((count(case when loan_status= 'Fully Paid' or loan_status= 'current' then id end)*100/COUNT(id) as 'Percentage_Good Loans' 
 from bank_data
;


# ChatGPT:
The SQL query you provided has a syntax error. There's a missing closing parenthesis for the COUNT function within the count() function. Here's the corrected version:
sql
Copy code
SELECT ((COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Fully Paid' OR loan_status = 'current' THEN id END) * 100) / COUNT(id)) AS 'Percentage_Good Loans' 
FROM bank_data;
This query calculates the percentage of "good loans" (where the loan_status is either 'Fully Paid' or 'current') in the bank_data table.


# MS Omkar:
Acting as an SQL expert could you please advice if the following SQL query for MySQL is properly framed? SELECT loan_status,
    COUNT(id) AS 'MTD_No. of Loan Applications',
    SUM(loan_amount) AS 'MTD_Total loan disbursed',
    SUM(total_payment) AS 'MTD_Total loan Recieved',
FROM bank_data
WHERE MONTH(issue_date)= 12,
GROUP BY loan_status


#ChatGPT:
The SQL query you provided has a couple of syntax errors and a logical issue. Here's the corrected version:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    loan_status,
    COUNT(id) AS 'MTD_No. of Loan Applications',
    SUM(loan_amount) AS 'MTD_Total loan disbursed',
    SUM(total_payment) AS 'MTD_Total loan Received'
FROM 
    bank_data
WHERE 
    MONTH(issue_date) = 12
GROUP BY 
    loan_status;
Here are the changes made:

Removed the comma after the last column (SUM(total_payment) AS 'MTD_Total loan Recieved') as it was causing a syntax error.
Replaced the comma with AND in the WHERE clause to filter records based on the issue date in December.
Removed the extra comma after WHERE clause, as it's not required.
Corrected the spelling of "Received" in the alias for the last column.
This query will give you the count of loan applications, total loan disbursed, and total loan received for each loan status for the month of December in the bank_data table.

Acting as an SQL expert could you please advice if the following SQL query for MySQL is properly framed? SELECT 
	MONTH(issue_date) AS 'Month Number',
    DATE NAME(MONTH,issue_date) AS 'Month',
    COUNT(id) AS 'No. of Loan Applications',
	SUM(loan_amount) AS 'Total loan disbursed',
	SUM(total_payment) AS 'Total loan Recieved',
	ROUND(AVG(int_rate)*100,2) AS 'Avg Interest Rate',
	ROUND(AVG(dti)*100,2) AS 'Avg DTI'
FROM
bank_data
GROUP BY DATE NAME(MONTH,issue_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(issue_data);


# ChatGPT:
The SQL query you provided has a few syntax errors and a function that doesn't exist in MySQL. Here's the corrected version:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    MONTH(issue_date) AS 'Month Number',
    MONTHNAME(issue_date) AS 'Month',
    COUNT(id) AS 'No. of Loan Applications',
    SUM(loan_amount) AS 'Total loan disbursed',
    SUM(total_payment) AS 'Total loan Received',
    ROUND(AVG(int_rate) * 100, 2) AS 'Avg Interest Rate',
    ROUND(AVG(dti) * 100, 2) AS 'Avg DTI'
FROM
    bank_data
GROUP BY
    MONTH(issue_date)
ORDER BY
    MONTH(issue_date);
Here are the changes made:

Changed DATE NAME(MONTH,issue_date) to MONTHNAME(issue_date) to correctly retrieve the name of the month.
Removed the extra space between DATE and NAME.
Corrected the alias for the total loan received to 'Total loan Received'.
Corrected the function for extracting the month name and number.
Removed the GROUP BY clause's redundant function, which was causing a syntax error.
Corrected the ORDER BY clause to sort by the month number extracted from the issue_date.
With these corrections, the query should execute properly in MySQL. It retrieves various statistics related to loan applications from the bank_data table, grouped by month.

# ChatGPT:
The SQL query you provided appears to be properly framed. It retrieves various statistics related to loan applications from the bank_data table, grouped by month and sorted by month number. Here's the query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    MONTH(issue_date) AS 'Month Number',
    MONTHNAME(issue_date) AS 'Month',
    COUNT(id) AS 'No. of Loan Applications',
    SUM(loan_amount) AS 'Total loan disbursed',
    SUM(total_payment) AS 'Total loan Received'
FROM
    bank_data
GROUP BY 
    MONTH(issue_date)
ORDER BY 
    MONTH(issue_date);
This query calculates the count of loan applications, total loan amount disbursed, and total loan amount received for each month, based on the issue_date column in the bank_data table. The results are grouped by month and ordered by the month number
